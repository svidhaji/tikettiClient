### Contributing

`master` this will only be reserved for releases. PL would be the one to update this

`develop` every time we do feature or fixes, branch out from develop and prefix the branch with the type of task:

- chore/<short-summary> - setup or refactoring tasks
- feat/<short-summary> - new features
- fix/<short-summary> - bug fixes

Once done, thoroughly test it first before creating a pull request against develop branch.
